### ğŸ”— Dependencies
Our dataset includes destructive augmentations based on Perlin Noise. We offer a GPU-based implementation of Perlin Noise, available in this [repository](https://github.com/uc-vision/taichi_perlin).
For data visualization, we recommend our previously developed library, accessible via this [link](https://github.com/uc-vision/synthetic-trees).
An example augmentation can be done using `python augmentation.py`
